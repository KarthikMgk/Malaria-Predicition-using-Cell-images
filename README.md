### Task
Given these images, I have designed a simple CNN that classify these images with 92% validation accuracy.

### Acknowledgements
This Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/ And uploaded here, so anybody trying to start working with this dataset can get started immediately, as to download the dataset from NIH website is quite slow.

### Inspiration
Save humans by detecting and deploying Image Cells that contain Malaria or not!
